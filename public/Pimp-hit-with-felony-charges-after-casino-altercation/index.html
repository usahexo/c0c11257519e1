<p>Darrin Basham, 35, is accused of striking the woman repeatedly in the face and head, then grabbing her by the hair and dragging her across the pavement.</p>
<p>The victim suffered multiple facial fractures, a concussion and other injuries.</p>
<h1 id="Gopher-Gold-game-goes-sour-for-pimp-after-run-in-with-security"><a href="#Gopher-Gold-game-goes-sour-for-pimp-after-run-in-with-security" class="headerlink" title="Gopher Gold game goes sour for pimp after run-in with security"></a>Gopher Gold game goes sour for pimp after run-in with security</h1><p>Pimp had high hopes for the Gopher Gold game, but things didn’t quite go as planned. After running into security near the end of the game, pimp was escorted out of the stadium and missed the chance to celebrate with his team.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to have some fun and enjoy the game like everyone else,” said pimp. “But I guess they didn’t want me there.”</p>
<p> Security officials said that pimp was being disruptive and causing a disturbance. They added that he was warned multiple times before being removed from the stadium.</p>
<p>“We simply want everyone to be able to enjoy the game in a safe and secure environment,” said a security spokesperson.</p>
<p>pimp insisted that he was not doing anything wrong and that he was just trying to have some harmless fun. However, he acknowledged that he may have been too rowdy for some people’s taste.</p>
<p>“It’s all good though,” said pimp. “I had a great time at the game, even if it didn’t end how I wanted it to.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-security-detains-pimp-after-physical-altercation"><a href="#Casino-security-detains-pimp-after-physical-altercation" class="headerlink" title="Casino security detains pimp after physical altercation"></a>Casino security detains pimp after physical altercation</h1><p>Just before 3am this morning, security at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas detained a pimp after a physical altercation with one of his prostitutes. According to eye-witnesses, the pimp had become enraged when one of his prostitutes lost a large amount of money at the casino. He began screaming and cursing at her before grabbing her by the arm and dragging her outside. It was then that casino security intervened, detaining the pimp until police arrived.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that violence has erupted inside a Las Vegas casino. In fact, in recent years there have been several high-profile incidents involving casino security and sex workers. In 2014, for example, security personnel at the Hard Rock casino were caught on video brutally beating two women after they were caught stealing chips from a gaming table. And in 2012, a pimp was shot and killed by security guards at the MGM Grand after he attacked them with a knife.</p>
<p>So why is it that casinos seem to attract such violent behavior? There are likely several factors at play, including the fact that many sex workers rely on casinos to make a living. Casinos also tend to be chaotic environments with lots of people and distractions, which can make it easy for criminals to hide their activities. And finally, casino security is often known for being aggressive and confrontational, which can lead to tense situations like the one this morning in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>According to reports, Pimp was engaged in a physical altercation with another individual at the casino when security personnel intervened. Pimp was subsequently arrested and booked into the county jail.</p>
<p>Pimp is being held on a $10,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court later this month.</p>
<h1 id="Gopher-Gold-game-turns-into-a-nightmare-for-pimp"><a href="#Gopher-Gold-game-turns-into-a-nightmare-for-pimp" class="headerlink" title="Gopher Gold game turns into a nightmare for pimp"></a>Gopher Gold game turns into a nightmare for pimp</h1><p>The Golden Gopher football game against Illinois State turned into a total nightmare for one Minneapolis man who goes by the name of “Pimp.”</p>
<p>Pimp had been planning to host a large watch party at his house for the game, but things quickly went downhill. Not only did the Gophers lose the game, 34-10, but Pimp’s house was also egged and vandalized.</p>
<p>According to reports, Pimp’s house was pelted with eggs and toilet paper while someone spray-painted “LOSER” on his garage. It’s unclear exactly what prompted the outburst of anger, but it’s likely that Pimp and his friends were not happy with the Gophers’ performance.</p>
<p>The vandalism is still being investigated by police, but at this point it doesn’t look like they have any leads. If you have any information about this incident, please contact the Minneapolis Police Department.</p>
