            <h1 id="Buffalo-Bills-to-make-it-to-the-playoffs"><a href="#Buffalo-Bills-to-make-it-to-the-playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Buffalo Bills to make it to the playoffs?"></a>Buffalo Bills to make it to the playoffs?</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills have not been to the playoffs in years, but this season they may just make it. The Bills have a strong offense led by LeSean McCoy and a defense that is getting better each game.</p>
<p>The Bills kicked off their 2017 season with a 21-12 win over the New York Jets. In that game, the Bills offense was able to move the ball well, but struggled in the red zone. The Bills defense was able to hold the Jets offense scoreless until late in the game.</p>
<p>In their second game of the season, the Bills hosted the Carolina Panthers. The Bills were able to pull off the upset, winning 23-3. In that game, the Bills defense was dominant, holding Cam Newton and the Panthers offense to just three points. The Bills offense was also able to score some points, including a 58-yard touchdown run by LeSean McCoy.</p>
<p>The Bills then traveled to Atlanta to take on the Falcons. The Falcons are one of the best teams in the NFL and many people believed that this would be a blowout loss for Buffalo. However, that was not the case. The Bills were able to keep the game close, losing 23-17. This showed that Buffalo has what it takes to compete with some of the best teams in the NFL.</p>
<p>The Bills are now 3-1 and sit in first place in their division. They have a bye this week and will next play on October 8th against Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<h1 id="Tyrod-Taylor-Buffalo-Bills’-starting-QB"><a href="#Tyrod-Taylor-Buffalo-Bills’-starting-QB" class="headerlink" title="Tyrod Taylor: Buffalo Bills’ starting QB"></a>Tyrod Taylor: Buffalo Bills’ starting QB</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills announced on Tuesday that Tyrod Taylor will be the team’s starting quarterback in 2017. This comes as a surprise to many, as the Bills were expected to go after Tony Romo or Jimmy Garoppolo in free agency.</p>
<p>However, with both of those players signing with other teams, the Bills decided to stick with Taylor. He had a solid 2016 season, throwing for 3,023 yards and 17 touchdowns while also rushing for 580 yards and six touchdowns.</p>
<p>Although he is not considered one of the top quarterbacks in the league, he is a good fit for the Bills’ offense and should be able to lead them to some success in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Rex-Ryan-Buffalo-Bills-head-coach"><a href="#Rex-Ryan-Buffalo-Bills-head-coach" class="headerlink" title="Rex Ryan: Buffalo Bills head coach"></a>Rex Ryan: Buffalo Bills head coach</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills have announced that they have hired Rex Ryan as their new head coach.</p>
<p>Ryan is a veteran head coach who has previously coached the New York Jets and the Baltimore Ravens. He is known for being a very outspoken head coach, and he is also known for his aggressive defense.</p>
<p>Ryan brings a lot of experience to the Buffalo Bills, and he also brings a lot of personality. He is sure to be a polarizing figure in Buffalo, but he also has the potential to be a very successful head coach.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills have had some bad luck in recent years, but with Ryan at the helm, they may be able to turn things around. He has a track record of winning, and he knows how to get the most out of his players.</p>
<p> Ryan is sure to be exciting to watch, and Bills fans are hopeful that he can lead the team back to success.</p>
<h1 id="Sammy-Watkins-Buffalo-Bills-wide-receiver"><a href="#Sammy-Watkins-Buffalo-Bills-wide-receiver" class="headerlink" title="Sammy Watkins: Buffalo Bills wide receiver"></a>Sammy Watkins: Buffalo Bills wide receiver</h1><p>Sammy Watkins was drafted by the Buffalo Bills with the fourth pick in the 2014 NFL Draft. Watkins is a wide receiver who played college football at Clemson.</p>
<p>In his first season with the Bills, Watkins had modest numbers, totaling 597 yards and 2 touchdowns on 63 receptions. The following year, Watkins had a breakout season, totaling 1,047 yards and 9 touchdowns on 60 receptions.</p>
<p>Watkins suffered a foot injury early in the 2016 season and only played in 8 games. He finished the season with 430 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 receptions.</p>
<p>The 2017 season was another injury plagued season for Watkins. He played in only 8 games and totaled 430 yards and 2 touchdowns on 28 receptions.</p>
<p>The 2018 season was a bounce back year for Watkins. He totaled 824 yards and 10 touchdowns on 57 receptions. He was also selected to his first Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>Watkins is entering the final year of his rookie contract with the Bills and is set to become a free agent at the end of the 2020 season.</p>
<h1 id="LeSean-McCoy-Buffalo-Bills-running-back"><a href="#LeSean-McCoy-Buffalo-Bills-running-back" class="headerlink" title="LeSean McCoy: Buffalo Bills running back"></a>LeSean McCoy: Buffalo Bills running back</h1><p>Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy has been one of the best players in the NFL this season. McCoy has rushed for 917 yards and six touchdowns, and he has also caught 38 passes for 292 yards. McCoy is a dynamic player who can make big plays both running and receiving the ball.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills have had a disappointing season, but McCoy has been one of the few bright spots. He is a Cy Young candidate and should be in the running for MVP as well. The Buffalo Bills are scheduled to play the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, and McCoy is likely to have a big game against his former team.</p>
<p>McCoy was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2009, and he played six seasons for that team. He was traded to the Buffalo Bills before the start of the 2015 season, and he has been a star player for them ever since. McCoy is a determined runner who can break tackles and pick up big chunks of yardage. He is also an excellent receiver out of the backfield, which makes him very dangerous in the open field.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills will likely make the playoffs this year, and LeSean McCoy will be a big reason why. He is one of the most valuable players in the NFL, and he will continue to make big plays for the Buffalo Bills for years to come</p>
