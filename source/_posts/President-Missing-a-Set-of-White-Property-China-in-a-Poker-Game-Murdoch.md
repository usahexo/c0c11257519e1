WASHINGTON - 

President Missing a Set of White Property China in a Poker Game Murdoch. The President is missing a set of white property and China is in the poker game, according to a new book by Rupert Murdoch.

The President has been missing the white property since he took office, according to the book by Murdoch. The revelation has stunned the political world and caused many to question how the President could have let this happen.

"This is a huge scandal," said one political analyst. "The President is supposed to protect our country and its people, but he's instead been sitting on his hands while our nation's secrets are falling into the hands of our enemies."

Murdoch has come under fire for his book, with many accusing him of being nothing more than a partisan hack out to damage the President. But he insists that he is simply trying to get at the truth.

"I am not attacking the President," said Murdoch. "I am simply trying to get at the truth about what happened here. The American people deserve to know what went on behind closed doors at the White House."

#  President Loses Important China in High Stakes Poker Game

In a stunning turn of events, President Trump has reportedly lost China to Russia in a high stakes poker game. The development is sure to cause alarm in Washington and among America's allies around the world.

According to sources close to the president, Trump placed a large bet on China during a game of Texas Hold'em last weekend and lost when Russian president Vladimir Putin called his bluff. The loss means that Russia will now have significant influence over Beijing, including control over important Chinese assets and businesses.

It is not yet clear what led to Trump making such a risky bet, but some insiders say that he may have been trying to make up for earlier losses in the game. Putin is said to have taken advantage of Trump's desperation and won the hand with a high-value chip.

The news is likely to prompt criticism from Trump's opponents, who have already accused him of being too cozy with Putin. They will argue that this latest development proves that Trump can't be trusted to protect America's interests abroad.

Democrats are already calling for Congressional hearings into the matter, while some are calling for impeachment proceedings against the president. However, Republicans are likely to defend Trump, arguing that he was simply unlucky in this particular instance and that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part.

#  Property China Goes Missing Amidst President's Poker Game

In a startling turn of events, the Chinese property market has disappeared, leaving many developers and investors with huge losses. The disappearance of the market coincides with a highly publicized poker game between President Xi Jinping and billionaire Jack Ma, raising speculation that Xi is using the game as a cover to confiscate property from developers who have grown too powerful.

The government has denied any connection between the poker game and the missing market, but many observers are not convinced. "It's clear that Xi is using his position as president to enrich himself and his friends at the expense of ordinary citizens," said one analyst. "This is just another sign of his corruption and disregard for the rule of law."

The disappearance of the property market has sparked fears of a nationwide crash, and investors are desperately trying to sell their properties before prices fall any further. "It's a complete disaster," said one developer. "I've lost everything."

So far, the government has done nothing to calm these fears, and many people are worried that Xi will continue to plunder China's wealth while ordinary citizens suffer. "Xi is a shameless looter who cares nothing for ordinary people," said one protester. "We need to get rid of him before he destroys our country."

The room went silent as everyone turned to look at Xi. He was obviously embarrassed and didn't know what to say. Finally, he admitted that he had lost the property in a previous game.

The players considered his offer and eventually agreed to it. They were all excited to get their hands on a piece of Xi's white property and they left the room happy that they had won.
