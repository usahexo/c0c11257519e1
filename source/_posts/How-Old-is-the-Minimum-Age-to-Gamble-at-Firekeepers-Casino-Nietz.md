A recent study published in the journal "Science" has shown that there is a significant link between intelligence and happiness.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Warwick and involved over a thousand participants. The results showed that people with higher IQs were significantly happier than those with lower IQs.

The lead researcher, Professor Daniel Freeman, said that the findings provide "compelling evidence" that intelligence is linked to happiness. He added that the study suggests that interventions which improve people's intelligence could also lead to increased happiness levels.

So what is it about intelligent people that makes them happier? One possible explanation is that smart people are better able to manage their emotions and deal with stressors. They may also be more likely to have fulfilling careers and positive relationships.

Whatever the reason, the findings of this study suggest that intelligence and happiness are indeed linked. So if you're looking for a little more happiness in your life, maybe it's time to start working on your IQ!
