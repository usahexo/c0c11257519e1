#  Wynn Casino Is Moving!

The Wynn Casino is moving! This is great news for the casino and its many fans. The new location will be in Everett, Massachusetts and it is expected to open in 2019.

The Wynn Casino has been a staple in the Las Vegas strip for many years. It is one of the biggest and most popular casinos in the city. However, the casino is getting older and it needs more space. The new location will provide plenty of space for the casino to grow, as well as additional rooms for guests to stay in.

The move will also create jobs. The Wynn Casino plans to hire thousands of new employees to work at the Everett location. This is great news for people who are looking for work in the casino industry.

The move is also good news for the city of Everett. The city has been working hard to develop its downtown area, and the addition of the Wynn Casino will help to bolster this development. In addition, the casino will pay millions of dollars in taxes each year, which will help to fund important municipal projects.

The Wynn Casino is excited about the move and so are its fans. The new location is sure to be a success and it will provide an economic boost to both Las Vegas and Everett.

#  Wynn moving to a new, larger home!

The Wynn Casino is finding a new home! Steve Wynn, the owner of the casino has announced that he will be moving to a new, larger home. The new property will be located in Las Vegas and span across 63 acres.

The new home for the Wynn Casino will include a hotel, spa, retail space and of course, the casino! This is great news for those who love to gamble as the Wynn Casino is one of the best in town.

Construction for the new property is set to begin in 2020 and it is expected to be fully completed by 2022. This gives everyone plenty of time to save up for their trip to Vegas!

In addition to this news, Steve Wynn has also announced that he is stepping down from his role as CEO of the casino. He will be replaced by Matt Maddox who has been with the company since 2004.

This change in management is hopefully a sign of good things to come for the Wynn Casino. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for this iconic property!

#  Wynn Ten Or Better 10 Hand Game

The Wynn Ten Or Better 10 Hand Game is a popular casino game found at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas. The object of the game is to draw cards until you have a hand that totals 10 or better.

The game begins by each player placing an ante bet. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to the dealer. The face down card in the dealer’s hand is called the hole card.

Players must now decide whether to fold or continue in the game by making a second bet, which is double the size of the ante bet. If a player folds, they forfeit their ante bet and any additional bets made are also forfeited. If a player chooses to continue in the game, they must place another bet equal to their original ante bet.

The dealer will then reveal their two cards. If the dealer has a hand totaling less than 10, they must draw another card. Once the dealer has drawn their cards, if their total is still less than 10, they must hit again. If the dealer’s total equals 10 or better after drawing cards, all players who haven’t folded lose their bets except for those who have a higher hand value than the dealers. The highest hand value beats the dealers hand value no matter what rank it is. For example, if both players have an Ace High hand, the player with the 2 kicker would win as opposed to losing to a Dealer King High hand.

If one or more players have not folded and have hands totaling 10 or better after both players and dealer have drawn cards, these players go into a showdown just like in poker. The player with the best high hand wins the pot. In case of a tie (e.g two players have an Ace High hand), the pot is split between these players evenly

#  Wynn up and moving!

Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) announced Thursday that it has reached an agreement with HM Capital Partners and other investors to move the company's headquarters from Las Vegas to Boston.

HM Capital Partners is a venture capital firm founded in 1999 by Bob Murchison, a Wynn Director and significant shareholder.
