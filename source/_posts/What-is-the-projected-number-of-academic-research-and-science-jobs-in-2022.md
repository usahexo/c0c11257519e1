#  What is the projected number of academic research and science jobs in 2022?

According to a study by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, there will be over 1 million science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs in 2022. Out of this number, about two-thirds or 680,000 will be for academics conducting research.

The reason for the projected growth is due to the ever-increasing demand from businesses and industries for highly skilled workers in these areas. The number of STEM jobs has grown three times faster than other occupations in the past decade.

What does this mean for students? It means that they should seriously consider studying a STEM field if they want a secure and prosperous future. STEM degrees offer good job prospects and high salaries.

For those who are already working in a STEM field, the news is also good. The Georgetown study found that those with a STEM degree earn 26% more than their counterparts with non-STEM degrees.

So what is preventing more young people from pursuing STEM careers? One reason is that many students do not have access to quality STEM education. According to the report, “students of color are especially underrepresented in fields like engineering and computer science”.

Another issue is gender disparity. Despite comprising half of the population, women hold only 29% of all STEM jobs. This needs to change if America wants to stay competitive in the global economy.

The bottom line is that America needs more scientists and researchers if it wants to maintain its status as a world leader in innovation and technology. Students should seize this opportunity and pursue a career in academia or research.

#  How will the number of academic research and science jobs change by 2022?

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the number of jobs for scientists and engineers will grow by 13% between 2012 and 2022. While this is a positive projection, it is worth noting that certain specialties within these categories are growing at a faster rate.

According to a report released by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the number of engineering doctorates awarded in the United States increased by 30% between 2003 and 2013. This dramatic increase can be attributed to a number of factors, including rising demand from industry and an aging population of professors.

What does this mean for academic research and science jobs?

The demand for engineers and scientists is expected to continue to grow over the next decade, although the field may become increasingly competitive as more students pursue degrees in these areas. Those with advanced degrees and experience in specific niche fields will have the best prospects for finding employment.

#  What fields will have the most academic research and science jobs in 2022?

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its report on the top 10 occupational projections for 2022, based on data gathered from Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. The report is a compilation of projected growth and decline rates for more than 800 occupations.

The field with the most job growth is projected to be biomedical engineering, with a 34% increase in jobs from 2012 to 2022. This is followed by computer science jobs, which are expected to grow by 32%. Both of these fields are closely followed by health professions and sciences, including nursing, which is expected to have an overall job growth rate of 26%.

The top ten Fields with the Most Job Growth in 2022:

1. Biomedical Engineering 
2. Computer Science 
3. Health Professions and Sciences 
4. Physics 
5. Chemical Engineering 
6. Civil Engineering 
7. Electrical Engineering 
8. Environmental Science 
9. Mathematics 
10 Mechanical Engineering

#  What are some challenges researchers and scientists face when seeking a job?

A career in research or science can be highly rewarding, but it can also be challenging. There are many things researchers and scientists need to consider when seeking a job, such as where they want to work, what type of research they want to do, and what their skills are.

One of the biggest challenges researchers face is finding the right position. There are many different types of research jobs available, from academia to industry. It is important for researchers to find a position that matches their interests and skills.

Another challenge is keeping up with the latest developments in their field. Science and technology move quickly, and researchers need to stay current in order to be competitive. This can be difficult if they are not always able to access the latest information.

Scientists also face many challenges when seeking funding for their research projects. It can be difficult to find sponsors who are willing to invest in new or risky projects. Often, scientists must compete for funding against other researchers with more established track records.

Finding a job in research or science can be difficult, but it is also very rewarding. Researchers and scientists must keep up with the latest developments in their field and compete for funding, but if they are successful, they can make significant contributions to society.

#  What factors influence a person's decision to pursue an academic research or science career?

There are many factors that influence a person’s decision to pursue an academic research or science career. The most important of these factors may be the intrinsic motivation of the individual. Intrinsic motivation is the internal drive to do something because it is interesting or satisfying, rather than because it leads to external rewards such as money or fame. Individuals who are intrinsically motivated tend to be more creative and persistent in their work than those who are motivated by external rewards.

Other important factors that can influence a person’s decision to pursue a research or science career include:

-The level of scientific and technical training available in their country or region
-The availability of jobs in their field
-The level of competition for jobs in their field
-The availability of funding for research projects
-The quality of the scientific infrastructure (e.g., laboratories, equipment, etc.) in their region
-The level of support they receive from family and friends
-The amount of personal sacrifice they are willing to make (e.g., working long hours, spending time away from family and friends, etc.)
-The level of satisfaction they derive from their work
