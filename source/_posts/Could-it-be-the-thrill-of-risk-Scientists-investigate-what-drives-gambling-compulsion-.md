# Could it be the thrill of risk? Scientists investigate what drives gambling compulsion 

Gambling can be a fun way to spend some free time or a chance to make some extra money, but for some people it can become an addiction. A new study published in the journal “Nature Neuroscience” investigates what drives this compulsion. 

Some researchers believe that the thrill of risk-taking may be key. Dr. Luke Clark, one of the authors of the study, said, “It may be that for some people, there’s a kind of excitement or a kind of buzz that they get from taking risks. And that might be particularly strong in people who have problems with impulse control or tendency towards addiction.” 

Previous studies have shown that regions of the brain associated with pleasure and reward are activated when someone takes risks. This latest study used brain imaging techniques to see if there is a connection between these regions and gambling addiction. The study found that the same areas of the brain were activated in both problem gamblers and healthy volunteers when they were presented with gambling opportunities. 

The study’s lead author, Dr. Camilla Nord said, “We found that individuals with problematic gambling behavior had similar brain responses to healthy volunteers when they saw gambling opportunities. This suggests that at least some people with problematic gambling behavior may not realize they have a problem because their brains respond similarly to healthy volunteers.” 

The next step is to investigate whether therapies aimed at reducing excitement or risk-taking could help people with gambling addictions.

# Online casino gambling: Is it more addictive than traditional casinos? 

The growth of online casino gambling has been nothing short of astonishing. In the early days of the internet, gambling was limited to a few dozen sites. These days, there are hundreds of online casinos, and millions of people engage in online gambling every year.

So what is behind this growth? One reason is that online casinos offer players more opportunities to gamble than traditional casinos. There are also more games available online, and players can often access these games from their homes or phones. This convenience is a big draw for many people.

But some experts believe that there may be another reason for the growth of online casino gambling: it may be more addictive than traditional casinos. One study found that people who gamble online are two to three times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who gamble at traditional casinos.

There are several reasons for this. First, online casinos can be more addictive because they are easier to access and less risky. Players can gamble from the privacy of their homes, without having to worry about losing money or getting into trouble. And because there are so many different types of games available, players can often find one that suits their interests and preferences perfectly.

Another reason why online casino gambling may be more addictive is that it is often less regulated than traditional casinos. This means that players have fewer safeguards against problem gambling behaviors. There are also no limits on how much money people can lose when they gamble online, which can lead to disastrous consequences for some people.

So is online casino gambling more addictive than traditional casinos? The answer is yes and no. Online casinos certainly offer more opportunities for addictive behavior, but not everyone who gambles at an online casino will develop a problem. For some people, however, the ease of access and lack of regulation can make it very difficult to stop gambling, even if they want to do so

#  scientists identify gene variant linked to problem gambling 

Scientists at the University of British Columbia have identified a gene variant that is linked to problem gambling.

The study, which was published in the journal “PLOS ONE”, looked at data from more than 8,000 people who had participated in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).

The researchers found that a variant of the gene CADM2 was associated with an increased risk of problem gambling.

They also found that this gene variant was linked to an increased risk of other mental health problems, including alcohol use disorder and drug use disorder.

The lead author of the study, Dr. Andrew Leyton, said that the findings could help to inform treatment options for people with problem gambling.

“This is the first time that a specific gene has been implicated in problem gambling,” he said.

“Our findings suggest that CADM2 may be involved in the development of addictions more broadly. This information could be useful in developing treatments for problem gambling and other addictions.”

# Brain scan study sheds light on why some people become addicted to gambling 

A new study has found that people with a certain pattern of brain activity are more likely to develop gambling addiction.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, used brain scans to examine the link between gambling addiction and dopamine – a chemical in the brain associated with pleasure and reward.

The researchers found that people who become addicted to gambling tend to have a lower level of dopamine activity in a particular part of the brain called the striatum. This is the same part of the brain that is also activated by drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine.

“We believe this study is an important step in understanding why some people develop gambling addictions and others do not,” said study author Dr. Luke Clark.

Clark added that the findings could eventually lead to better treatments for gambling addiction.

Previous studies have shown that around 2 percent of the population suffers from gambling addiction, which can be extremely damaging both financially and emotionally.

The new study provides some insight into why some people are more susceptible to developing an addiction than others. It may be possible to use this information to develop targeted treatment interventions for those with a predisposition towards gambling addiction.

# Problem Gambling May Have Roots in Genetics

Problem gambling has long been associated with mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, but a new study suggests that genetics may also play a role.

The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at the genomes of more than 35,000 people with problem gambling and compared them to the genomes of more than 280,000 people without a gambling problem.

The researchers found that there were several genetic variants that were more common in people with problem gambling than in those without a gambling problem. The variants were associated with lower levels of dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that is thought to play a role in addiction.

The findings suggest that there may be a genetic component to problem gambling, and that people who are predisposed to addictive behaviors may be more likely to develop a gambling problem.

This doesn’t mean that everyone with a particular set of genes will develop a gambling problem, but it does suggest that there is some kind of underlying link between genetics and problem gambling.

It’s still not clear exactly how these genetic variants lead to problem gambling, but the findings could help us to understand why some people are more prone to developing this type of addiction.

This research could also lead to better treatments for problem gambling. Currently, most treatment options are based on behavioral therapies, but if we can identify the genes that contribute toproblem gambling, we may be able to develop medications or other treatments that target those genes specifically.
