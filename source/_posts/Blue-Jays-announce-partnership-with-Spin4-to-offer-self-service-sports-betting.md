#  Exclusive tips for betting on the Blue Jays

The Toronto Blue Jays had an up-and-down season in 2017, but they still managed to clinch a postseason berth. In this article, we will take a closer look at the Blue Jays and offer some tips for betting on their games.

First of all, the Blue Jays have some very talented players in their lineup. Josh Donaldson, Justin Smoak and Kendrys Morales are all capable of hitting home runs, and José Bautista is one of the best hitters in baseball. The Blue Jays also have a strong bullpen, led by Roberto Osuna.

With that said, the Blue Jays are not without flaws. They are vulnerable to left-handed pitchers, and their starting pitching is not as strong as it was in 2016. Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez are both good pitchers, but they are not elite starters.

In light of these facts, here are four tips for betting on the Blue Jays in 2018:

1) Bet on the Blue Jays when they are playing against left-handed pitchers.

2) Bet against the Blue Jays when they are playing against elite starting pitchers.

3) Bet on the Blue Jays when they are at home.

4) Place small bets on individual games rather than betting on the Blue Jays to win the World Series.

#  Blue Jays look to cement their lead in the AL East with help from Spin4

The Toronto Blue Jays currently sit atop the AL East division, but that doesn’t mean things are smooth sailing from here on out. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are both hot on their heels, so the Blue Jays need to take advantage of every opportunity they get.

Fortunately, help is on the way. Spin4, an artificial intelligence sports betting system, has endorsed the Blue Jays as strong favorites to win the division.

Spin4’s algorithm takes into account a variety of factors, including each team’s current form, strength of schedule, and odds of winning individual matchups. Based on this data, the algorithm gives each team a score which reflects its chances of winning the division.

The Blue Jays have a score of 86.5%, putting them well ahead of the Yankees (score: 58.7%) and Red Sox (score: 54.8%). In addition, they have better odds than any other team in baseball to win the World Series (score: 10.0%).

So far this season, Spin4 has correctly predicted the outcomes of more than 75% of all games. This includes correctly calling 15 out of 18 games in the AL East division.

The Blue Jays can officially clinch a playoff berth by winning their next two games against the Baltimore Orioles. If they manage to do that, they can start preparing for another deep postseason run.
