#  Gabon Gambler Wins Big With Blackjack Strategy

Casino goers around the world were amazed last week when a Gabon gambler walked away from a blackjack table with more than $372,000 in winnings. The secret to his success? A simple blackjack strategy that he had been using for years.

The gambler, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he had first learned about the strategy from a book called "Beat the Dealer" by Edward O. Thorp. The book, which was first published in 1962, teaches players how to beat the dealer at blackjack by using basic mathematical principles.

Thorp's strategy is based on the fact that the dealer has to hit on soft 17 (a hand consisting of an Ace and a 6, for example) while players can choose to stand or hit depending on their own hand. By keeping track of what cards have already been played, players can make informed decisions about when to stand or hit in order to maximise their chances of winning.

The Gabon gambler said that he had been using the strategy for years and that it had never failed him. "I've always been pretty good at maths so I was able to understand the concepts fairly easily," he said. "It's all about making smart decisions based on the odds and not just going with your gut instinct."

So far, the gambler has said that he doesn't plan on giving up his day job anytime soon. "I'm going to keep playing occasionally but I'm not going to rely on blackjack as my only source of income," he said. "There's too much risk involved."

#  Blackjack A Sure Thing In Gabon Gambling Scene

Blackjack is a favorite game in Gabon's casino gambling scene. It's easy to learn and offers players the chance to win big payouts if they're lucky.

 disregarding the house edge, blackjack is one of the casino games with the best odds for players. This means that over the long term, a player has the best chance of winning money playing blackjack as opposed to other casino games.

# The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that involves players trying to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points each, while other cards are worth their rank value. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what is most advantageous for the player.

The game begins with players placing bets on the table. Once everyone has placed their bets, the dealer will deal out two cards to each player - one face up, and one face down. The dealer will also deal out two cards to themselves - one face up, and one face down. At this point, players will need to decide what course of action to take: hit (take another card), stand (stick with what you've got), double down (double your bet and take one more card), or split (split your hand into two separate hands).

If a player goes over 21 points with their cards, they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. The dealer must also hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or higher. The winner is the first player to reach 21 points or exceed it with their total score; if both players have 21 points at the same time, then it's a tie.

# Blackjack Variations in Gabon

While classic blackjack is most popular in Gabon's casinos, there are some variations available depending on where you play. These include:
7-card stud: In this variation, players are dealt seven cards instead of just two - three face up and four face down. After seeing their initial hand, players must choose whether to keep all seven cards or discard any number of them and replace them with new ones from the deck. The aim is still to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. 

Pontoon: This variation is very similar to classic blackjack but uses a different set of rules related specifically to drawing cards and hitting/standing (for example, you can only hit once on any given hand).

Spanish 21: Spanish 21 is played with a regular deck of 52 cards plus four jokers (which act as wildcards). The aim of the game is still to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over; however, if you achieve this total using just three or four cards (called a "Natural"), you immediately win regardless of what the dealer has.
